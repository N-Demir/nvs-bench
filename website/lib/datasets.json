    "dataset_description": "9 orbiting scenes (5 outdoors and 4 indoors) each containing a complex central object or area and a detailed background. During capture authors attempted to prevent photometric variation by fixing camera exposure settings, minimizing lighting variation, and avoiding moving objects. Camera poses obtained with COLMAP. Image resolutions, following best practices, have been pre-downsampled 2x for indoor and 4x for outdoor scenes.",
